Face Recognition using Self-Supervised Learning (SimCLR) and Transfer Learning 



This project focuses on developing a Face Recognition model using the SimCLR (Contrastive Learning) approach and Transfer Learning. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the ResNet18 architecture, to learn complex facial features for robust representation. Utilizing the Kaggle Faces Dataset, the Sim-CLR technique is applied for unsupervised pre-training, enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle facial differences. Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques diversify the dataset, improving generalization. The pre-trained encoder undergoes fine-tuning with the Sim-CLR contrastive loss function. A downstream ResNet18 CNN is integrated for face recognition classification, utilizing Sim-CLR encoder representations as input. Rigorous testing evaluates model performance, emphasizing ethical considerations and regulatory adherence in the face recognition technology landscape. This project advances face recognition by combining SimCLR's unsupervised learning with CNNs for accurate and efficient recognition across diverse conditions, contributing to real-world applications such as security surveillance and social media platforms.
